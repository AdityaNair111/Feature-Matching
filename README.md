# Local Feature Matching


# Setup
- Install <a href="https://conda.io/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a>. Either 2.7 or 3.6 because this project creates its own environment so anything is fine.
- Create a conda environment, using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed "Conda prompt" to run this command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command. Modify the command based on your OS ('linux', 'mac', or 'win'): `conda env create -f environment_<OS>.yml`
- This should create an environment named `local_features`. Activate it using the following Windows command: `activate local_features` or the following MacOS / Linux command: `source activate local_features`.
- Run the notebook using: `jupyter notebook ./code/proj2.ipynb`
